Generate 512-bit primes p and q, find φ(n) and n. Randomly choose e and find the corresponding d, according to RSA parameter generation constraints. Output p, q, φ(n), n, e, d to a file called parameters.txt.\
Read the required parameters from parameters.txt and the message from plain. txt. Your message should be ASCII text. Note that your message (and later, your ciphertext) is not necessarily alphanumerical. Encode the message into an integer. (Hint: You can do this naively or by using functions supplied by MPIR/GMP that can convert binary data to mpz_t, take a look at the documentation.) If you cannot figure out how to encode, then use integers instead of text messages. However, you will lose points if you do so. The message you encrypt should have a size limit. How many characters can you fit in an RSA message for given parameters? Make the message size the maximum that you can. Encrypt the message using the parameters that you have read from the file. Decode the ciphertext from the integer result back to characters. Output that to cipher.txt.\
Read cipher.txt and parameters.txt. Decrypt the data from cipher.txt using the encoding from Part 2. Write the decrypted message into message.txt.
